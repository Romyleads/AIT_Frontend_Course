              Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta accounts
              for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing cluster of
              states led by Rio where arabica is produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the
              northwestern much smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.

            <p>
              Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee beans. Colombia's average annual coffee
              production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and Vietnam; though
              highest in terms of the arabica bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and
              Italy. Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.

              Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as Indian
              monsooned coffee. Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics of Pacific
              coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring." The two well known species of coffee grown are the
              Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is S.795.

            <p>
              Ethiopian beans can be divided into 3 categories: Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha. Longberry varieties
              consist of the largest beans and are often considered of the highest quality in both value and flavor.
              Shortberry varieties are smaller. The Mocha variety is a highly prized commodity. Mocha Harars are known
              for their peaberry beans that often have complex chocolate, spice and citrus notes.

            <p>
              Costa Rican coffee beans are considered among the best in the world. Tarrazu is thought to produce the
              most desirable coffee beans in Costa Rica. In 2012, Tarrazu Geisha coffee became the most expensive coffee
              sold by Starbucks in 48 of their stores in the United States, using the Clover automated French press. The
              finest coffee is typically grown at altitudes of 1200 to 1700 meters.

            <p>
              The acidic soil in highlands of central Kenya, just the right amount of sunlight and rainfall provide
              excellent conditions for growing coffee plants. Coffee from Kenya is of the 'Colombia mild' type, and is
              well known for its intense flavor, full body, and pleasant aroma with notes of cocoa and high grade coffee
              from Kenya is one of the most sought-after coffees in the world.
